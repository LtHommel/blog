I envy the people with blogs with years long archives and admire the ones who put out silly projects. For the longest time I&rsquo;ve fantasized about being one of them. Instead, I&rsquo;m a lurker.</p>
<p>I never created that website because I didn&rsquo;t know what to do with it. And I still don&rsquo;t know. But I&rsquo;m done waiting until inspiration strikes.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the plan: put <em>something</em> online every week, and report back here if that something sits elsewhere.</p>
<p>Now, something is quite a vague term, but that&rsquo;s deliberate. There&rsquo;s a ton of things that could be a something. It could be a blog post, a commit to a project, a comment on something I read, a photograph, a bug report. Anything goes as long as it is visible to anyone who&rsquo;s interested, and it wasn&rsquo;t there the week prior.</p>
<p>Consider this my first something :)</p>
