I read personal blogs and I love weird and useless websites. I envy the people with blogs with years long archives and admire the ones who put out silly projects. For the longest time I've fantasized about being one of them. Instead, I'm a lurker. 

I never created that website because I didn't know what to do with it. And I still don't know. But I'm done waiting until inspiration strikes.

So here's the plan: put *something* online every week, and report back here if that something sits elsewhere. 

Now, something is quite a vague term, but that's deliberate. There's a ton of things that could be a something. It could be a blog post, a commit to a project, a comment on something I read, a photograph, a bug report. Anything goes as long as it is visible to anyone who's interested, and it wasn't there the week prior.

Consider this my first something :)
