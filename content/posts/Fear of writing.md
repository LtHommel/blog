I am scared of writing. There, I said it. I wrote it! More specifically, I am scared of people reading my writing. 

Today I discovered that there is a word for fear of writing. It is called scriptophobia, not to be confused with graphophobia, the fear of handwriting. Scriptophobia is actually a form of social anxiety, it is a fear of being judged or otherwise being perceived in a negative light based on your writing. To me, a major difference between written and in person interactions is the persistence of what is written. If I put something in writing it's out there, potentially for ever. What if I make a mistake, or am misunderstood, or change my point of view? 

I've had therapy for this. At some point the fear had gotten so bad that I was barely able to compose the simplest message. Telling my colleagues I had an PR ready for review, answering a text from a friend, or writing a birthday card became daunting tasks, that took a large portion of my energy. With help, I've learned to not fear the judgement of my loved ones so much. The next step is to not fear what the rest of the world thinks of me. That's where this blog comes in. It's my exposure therapy. Not that I've shared the link with anyone. Not *yet*, hopefully. It can be found though, as it lives in a public repository, and that's exciting enough for now.
